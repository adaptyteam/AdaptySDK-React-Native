Adapty SDK is an open-source framework that makes implementing in-app subscriptions for React Native fast and easy. It’s 100% open-source and lightweight.

## Why Adapty?

- [On-the-fly paywalls price testing](https://docs.adapty.io/docs/ab-test?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=AdaptySDK-React-Native). Test different prices, duration, offers, messages, and designs simultaneously, all without new app releases.
- [Full customer's payment history](https://docs.adapty.io/docs/profiles-crm?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=AdaptySDK-React-Native). Explore the user's payment events from the trial start to subscription cancellation or billing issues.
- [In-app purchase data integration](https://docs.adapty.io/docs/events?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=AdaptySDK-React-Native). Send subscription events to 3rd-party analytics, attribution, and ad services with no coding, even if the user uninstalls the app.
- [No server code implementation](https://docs.adapty.io/docs/react-native-sdk-configuration?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=AdaptySDK-React-Native). Integrate in-app purchases with server-side receipt validation in minutes. Apple Promotional Offers supported out-of-the-box.
- [Advanced analytics](https://docs.adapty.io/docs/analytics-charts?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=AdaptySDK-React-Native). Analyze your app real-time metrics with advanced filters, such as Ad network, Ad campaign, country, A/B test, etc.
