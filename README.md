![Adapty: CRM for mobile apps with subscriptions](https://adapty-portal-media-production.s3.amazonaws.com/github/adapty-schema.png)

Adapty SDK is an open-source framework that makes implementing in-app subscriptions for React Native fast and easy. It’s 100% open-source and lightweight.

## Why Adapty?

- [No server code implementation](https://adapty.io/docs/sdk-installation-reactnative?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=AdaptySDK-React-Native). Integrate in-app purchases with server-side receipt validation in minutes — in your own paywall or one created in the no-code builder.
- [No-code paywall builder](https://adapty.io/docs/adapty-paywall-builder?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=AdaptySDK-React-Native). Create a beautiful, natively rendered paywall in the no-code editor and display it in your app to start getting paid instantly.
- [On-the-fly paywalls price testing](https://docs.adapty.io/v3.0/docs/ab-tests?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=AdaptySDK-React-Native). Test different prices, duration, offers, messages, and designs simultaneously, all without new app releases.
- [Beautiful onboardings](https://adapty.io/docs/onboardings?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=AdaptySDK-React-Native). Design onboardings in the no-code editor and guide users through their first app experience.
- [Full customer's payment history](https://docs.adapty.io/v3.0/docs/profiles-crm?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=AdaptySDK-React-Native). Explore the user's payment events from the trial start to subscription cancellation or billing issues.
- [3rd-party integrations](https://docs.adapty.io/v3.0/docs/events?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=AdaptySDK-React-Native). Send subscription events to 3rd-party analytics, attribution, and ad services with no coding, even if the user uninstalls the app.
- [Advanced analytics](https://docs.adapty.io/v3.0/docs/charts?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=AdaptySDK-React-Native). Analyze your app real-time metrics with advanced filters, such as Ad network, Ad campaign, country, A/B test, etc.

With Adapty, you can create a complete, purchase-ready paywall in the no-code builder.

Adapty automatically renders it and handles all the complex purchase flow, receipt validation, and subscription management behind the scenes.
